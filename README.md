# JitsiJWTLobbyExampleConfig
This repository contains example config files that enable a Jitsi server to authenticate users and determine moderation status with JWTs.  This informed moderation status is then leveraged to allow moderators to bypass the Jitsi lobby.

The forum post with accompanying setup instructions can be found [here](https://community.jitsi.org/t/tutorial-example-jwt-authentication-lobby/110230).
